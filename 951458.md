So here is my cheat sheet from the very starting

### Basic syntax
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
   return(0);
}
```
This is the boilerplate code for C.

### stdio.h 
So stdio.h is the standard header file in C which program has to include so some of the most usable and famous functions of it are

#### printf
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!"); // prints hello world to the screen
    return(0);
}
```
`printf` is the like `print` in python.


#### scanf
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int input;
    scanf("%d", &input); // make sure to add `&` to make it a reference 

    /*
       % is a format specifier

       %d or %i 		for int
       %ld or %li for 	        long int
       %f for 			float
       %lf for 		        double
       %c for 			char
       %s for 			string
    */

}
```


### Comments
The comments are just like `javascript`

#### Single Line Comment
```c
// It is a single line comment
```

#### Multi-Line Comment
```c
/*
  It is a 
  multi-line comment
*/
```

### Data types
The datatypes are as follows

#### Character type
Typically a single octet(one byte). It can only hold a single character

```c
char letter = "P";
```

For string you need to do something like this
```c
char name[14] = "Padmashree Jha"; // 14 is the length of the string

// BONUS
// You can also do this
```

```c
char name[] = "Padmashree Jha"; // creates a string variable of indefinite length
```

#### Integer type
The datatype to store integers.
```c
int favouriteNumber = 3;
```

#### Float type
The datatype to store float decimals
```c
float myFloatVariable = 3.4
```

#### Double type
The double type is used for storing extra large numbers
```c
double smallVar = 3.43;
double BigVar = 9875612096510479.97645; // I randomly typed it ðŸ˜‚
```
