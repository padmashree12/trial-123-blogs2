[Instructions]: # (To submit to the MongoDB Atlas Hackathon on DEV, please fill out all sections.)


### Overview of My Submission
So it is an online e-commerce book store as I did not have any name idea so I put **DEV Book store**.


### Submission Category: 
E-Commerce Creation

### Link to Code

{% github https://github.com/codewithpom/mongo-ecommerce %}



### Additional Resources / Info
So now let's come to the real topic how I built it so first of all let me tell you the resources and frameworks that I used

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) of course
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Just to make it sophisticated and so that I have to type less and intellisense will help ðŸ˜‚.
* [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) To send emails and etc you will know below
* [nextjs-progressbar](https://github.com/apal21/nextjs-progressbar) for the blue loading progress bar on the top (copied from GitHub)
* [react-use-cart](https://github.com/notrab/react-use-cart) For managing cart as I do not know how to create custom react hook ðŸ˜‚.
* [stripe](https://stripe.com/en-in) Ya who is even going to see the bank docs for payment ðŸ˜‚.

Now comes the boss

* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Atlas Search](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/atlas-search/)


So now that is too much about the resources now first I will give my review over MongoDB and it is that **I had never thought that database can be much easier as well** as I hated SQL earlier and used JSON files and they are not remote ðŸ˜”, but MongoDB was JSON and remote so I could use both in my server as well in compass.

So now here are some pics

![Out of stock book](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6frv8vekuvhun075sdao.png)

![Cart page](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/sn0dt682utja59no7dt3.png)
**Your task is to take screenshots of the other pages and post below**


So new let's break it down and see how it works
So let's start from the front page
So the products are in a component named ``Card.tsx`` and they are bootstrap cards with an awesome hover effect that I got from codepen ðŸ˜‚. So now let's see more so while making this project I learnt about `getServerSideProps` [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) so it runs on the server and then fetches the products from the database and then pass them as props. In the image I have also added a blur effect until the image is loaded using `next/image` [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) I got this idea after seeing the other normal sites where it did not load quick. I had very less days as I started on 1st January because I was too sick before that, but I also saw other submissions but they were vulnerable and got hacked  ðŸ˜ž that is why I did not let vulnerability in my code ðŸ˜Ž. Now each document my collection looks like
```json
{
    _id: "Id",
    name: "Name of the book",
    stock: 14, // example it is the number of books in stock and decrease using my webhook triggered by stripe
    image: "Image url of the book",
    author: "Author of the book",
    description: "Description of the book"
}
```

ya I know some of you would have got bored and even me so I am going to write a full-fledged series on how to make this site from the starting if I win.

Ok so now let me some of the features 
* **Search**  ya the search box works, try it
* **Email confirmation** There is a confirmation e-mail sent to you with your address once your checkout is done through a web hook. 

* **Stock system** Yes if something is out of stock you cannot order it as I check it while creating the session id and once checkout is done the stripe rebook send request to my server and it updates the number of books available.
* **Cart** Yes I know this is very common but while making it with stripe checkout was hard and I was using mongoDB and stripe for the first time but docs (the savior of programmers) helped me.

Hope you all liked it.


Wait, Wait I have one more request, comment your thoughts below and if there is someone from **mongoDB** or **DEV** please comment anything below so that I can show my friends that even great people read my blog ðŸ˜Ž.

Bye bye.
Yes you can even support me on buymeacoffee.
