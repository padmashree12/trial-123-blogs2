## Gitpod
If you are **vscode** fan then I am sure you will like **gitpod** very much.

## Introduction
So in short gitpod is an online ready to code platform which helps you to code **directly** in the **browser** from a **git repository**.

## Example
For example I have installed the gitpod chrome extension from 
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki), and now you need to create a gitpod account from [here](https://www.gitpod.io/#get-started), and then you are good to go.

## Play with a GitHub Repository 
Now if you go to any GitHub repository like this
