So this is my first blog and today I will show how to use **express** a javascript framework for making **servers**, and maybe sometimes there would be some mistakes in this blog in my writing as I am new, so comment it out.


## Introduction
Express is a web framework for **Node.js** here is there website link [http://expressjs.com/](http://expressjs.com/).You can know more about it by the link above.

## How to use
There are some requirements to learn express 
* Have Some Knowledge About **Node.js**
* Have Node.js installed (if you do not have installed you can install by [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/))
* A text-editor like **vscode** (if you do not have a text-editor installed then install vscode search for it on **google**)

## Good To Go
Once you have everything done we can go further.

## Sample Code
Now open vscode and create a new project and do 
```bash
npm init -y
```
and then do 
```bash
npm install express
```

and then we are good to go

## Starter code 
Now create an **index.js** file and in it put the following code
{% gist https://gist.github.com/codewithpom/01769a22d2ad5f6fe8c8855ef0f0f21c %} and save it.

## Start the server
Now as we have everything done we can start our server and to do that paste the following command in the terminal
```bash
node index.js
```
and then your server will start running and you can see your server response by going to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you will see a **Hello World** you van change it by changing the response text on line **8** and this link will work **only** on your device. So this was all this was the most simple express app and in my next blog we will learn how to deploy it so that you can see it from anywhere and if you want part 2, try to give a comment.
